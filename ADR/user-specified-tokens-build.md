# Enable users to configure tokens/credentials for a Build/Test Pipeline

Date: 2023-03-03

## Status

Provisional


## Context

As a user, I would like to configure sensitive information/tokens/credentials for the build/test pipeline to consume as part of a partner Task.

## What is a Partner Task

A Partner Task is a Tekton Task that is provided and maintained by a Red Hat Partner. However, this initiative also aims to enable Tekton Tasks
contributed to the StoneSoup Build/Test Pipeline by different organizations inside Red Hat.


## Decision

### How would the sensitive information be persisted and made available to the PipelineRun ?

1. The UI would take in sensitive information as form input and upload it to SPI using the user's authentication token. See https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/service-provider-integration-operator/blob/main/docs/USER.md#uploading-access-token-to-spi-using-kubernetes-secret .

2. Subsequently, the UI would create an `SPIAccessTokenBinding` CR with the appropriate label in the `.spec.secret.labels` to make the `Secrets` available to the build service or the integration service.


### How does the build service and the integration service discover the `Secrets` ?

While uploading a token, the user should be able to choose the name of the Pipeline `parameter` from a UI dropdown. The dropdown would be a pre-populated and hard-coded list of names associated with known partner integrations.

The user should also be allowed to provide a parameter name of choice. The same could be used in a customized PipelineRun definition in the user's source code's .tekton/ directory.

| Pipeline Parameter    | Contents of the Secret | Name of the Secret        |
| --------------------  | ---------------------- | ------------------------  |
| codecov-github-token  | *input from the user*  | *autogenerated*           |
| codecov-token-secret  | *input from the user*  | *autogenerated*           |
| redhat-ocm-token      | *input from the user*  | *autogenerated*           |
| *input from the user* | *input from the user*  | *autogenerated*           |


The build-service or the integration-service, reponsible for generating the PipelineRun needs to be able to map the name of the PipelineRun `parameter` with that of the `Secret` created by the UI, with contents provided by the user. To help the build-service do so, the `secrets` would be labelled with the name of the parameter for the build-service to look up, by the UI.

```
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1beta1
kind: SPIAccessTokenBinding
metadata:
 name: doesnt-matter
 namespace: user-tenant
spec:
 repoUrl: https://snyk.io/
 secret:
   type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
   labels:
     "appstudio.redhat.com/codecov-github-token":"true"
```

### How would these tokens/secrets be rotated ?

1. The user revokes the secret outside of Stonesoup.
2. The user generates a new credential outside of Stonesoup.
3. The user overwrites the secret in Stonesoup with a new one using our UI.

## Consequences

* The build-service and the integration service needs to be able to read the contents of all secrets in the namespace.
* The UI would need to update the list of parameter names expected in the dropdown whenever a new partner is onboarded.
* The Build team would need to provide a hardcoded list of parameter names to the UI team that we expect users to be able to configure. This has to be done everytime a new partner is onboarded.
* If a user wants to configure a secret on multiple workspaces (i.e. for integration tests), they will need to set the secret multiple times, even if the content is the same.

## Out-of-scope

* Making the senstive tokens available in other namespaces or clusters.
* Handling a token rotation strategy. At the moment, as suggested, we will support updating/deletion of the token.
