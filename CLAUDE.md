# CLAUDE.md - Konflux Architecture Documentation

## Context Loading Rules

**Read selectively. Never read all files. Use grep before reading.**

### Core Services (`/architecture/core/`)
- `build-service.md` - Build pipelines, compilation, container image builds
- `enterprise-contract.md` - Policy enforcement, compliance validation, supply chain security
- `hybrid-application-service.md` - Git webhooks, application/component validation
- `integration-service.md` - Testing orchestration, snapshots, promotion logic
- `konflux-ui.md` - Web UI (minimal architecture docs, see repository)
- `pipeline-service.md` - Tekton infrastructure, pipeline execution foundation
- `release-service.md` - Release automation, deployment to production environments

**Note:** `/architecture/core/index.md` exists (~175 lines) but should NOT be read directly. Use grep to search for service relationships and interaction patterns only when understanding multi-service workflows.

### Add-ons (`/architecture/add-ons/`)
- `image-controller.md` - Image repository management and configuration
- `internal-services.md` - Internal job execution via remote cluster polling
- `mintmaker.md` - Automated dependency updates using Renovate
- `multi-platform-controller.md` - Multi-architecture build orchestration
- `project-controller.md` - Project and development stream management via templating

**Note:** `/architecture/add-ons/index.md` exists (~180 lines) but should NOT be read directly. Use grep to search for service relationships and interaction patterns only when understanding multi-service workflows.

### Loading Process

1. Map feature → 1-2 services (don't read yet)
2. Read service frontmatter only (start with the first 15 lines) and look at the local_summary to determine if information is relevant
3. Grep for keywords in service file
4. Read matched sections only (not entire file)
5. Search `/ADR/INDEX.md` for relevant ADRs
6. Read ADR first 30 + last 20 lines (not full file)
7. Read `/architecture/index.md` only if 3+ services involved

### Core Architectural Constraints (Always Apply)

- **API Model**: Kubernetes API server (controllers + CRDs), no REST APIs
- **Async-only**: All operations asynchronous, no synchronous operations
- **Tekton-based**: User-extensible operations executed via Tekton pipelines
- **OCI artifacts**: Primary deliverable format for all builds
- **Cluster isolation**: Each cluster independent (unit of sharding/tenancy)
- **Resource flow**: Application → Component → Snapshot → IntegrationTestScenario → ReleasePlan → Release

### Repository Structure

- `/architecture/` - Service documentation and full system overview
  - `/core/` - Core service markdown files
  - `/add-ons/` - Optional service markdown files
  - `index.md` - Complete architecture overview (LARGE - use sparingly)
- `/ADR/` - Architecture Decision Records (50+ files - use INDEX.md for discovery)
- `/diagrams/` - Architecture diagrams in SVG format (draw.io)
- `/ref/` - API references (auto-generated during publish)

### Key Resource Definitions

- **Application** - Functionally coherent set of Components
- **Component** - Git repository/branch that produces OCI artifacts
- **Snapshot** - Immutable collection of OCI artifacts mapped to Components
- **IntegrationTestScenario** - Test definitions executed against Snapshots
- **ReleasePlan** - Release pipeline definition for promoting Snapshots
- **Release** - Actual release request for specific Snapshot artifacts


### Notes

- This is a **documentation-only repository** (no code, builds, tests, or linters)
- Diagrams created with draw.io, stored as SVG in `/diagrams/`
- ADRs follow template in `/ADR/0000-adr-template.md`
- All changes require peer-reviewed pull requests
