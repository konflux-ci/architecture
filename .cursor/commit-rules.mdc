# Commit Rules for Cursor

## Commit Message Format

Every commit message created by Cursor must include:

1. **DCO Signoff**: The Developer Certificate of Origin signoff line at the bottom
2. **Assisted-by Line**: Indication that the commit was assisted by Cursor

Every commit message created by cursor should include:

3. Conventional-commits style type prefix with an emoji of your choice.

## Required Format

```
<emoji> <type>(<scope>): <description>

<commit message body>

Signed-off-by: <git author name> <git author email>
Assisted-by: Cursor
```

## Example

```
🚀 feat(tools): Add Mermaid diagram validation with Makefile and hack scripts

- Add Makefile with targets for linting, validation, and development tasks
- Create hack/ directory with individual scripts for each target
- Refactor architecture documentation organization
- Enhance Mermaid diagrams with improved readability

Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
Assisted-by: Cursor
```

## Conventional Commit Types & Emojis

- **feat**: 🚀 New features
- **fix**: 🐛 Bug fixes  
- **docs**: 📚 Documentation changes
- **style**: 💅 Code style/formatting changes
- **refactor**: 🔧 Code refactoring
- **test**: 🧪 Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: 🛠️ Maintenance tasks, dependencies, etc.
- **perf**: ⚡ Performance improvements
- **ci**: 🔄 CI/CD changes

## Implementation Notes

- The DCO signoff must use the currently registered git author
- The "Assisted-by: Cursor" line must always be present
- Both lines should be at the very bottom of the commit message
- Use `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` to get current author info
- Always include an appropriate emoji and conventional commit type
- Use descriptive scope when applicable (e.g., `feat(tools)`, `fix(docs)`)
